description:
    - Developed a custom real-time rendering engine with support for PBR, shadow mapping, and post-processing effects
    - Wrote shaders for dynamic lighting, PBR materials, and screen-space effects including box blur, chromatic aberration, and custom animated visuals
    - Built an in-engine UI using ImGui to visualize render pipeline stages and provide real-time control over scene composition, entity properties, materials, and rendering settings

## Overview
A custom real-time rendering engine built to explore modern graphics techniques and low-level engine development.

## Rendering Features
- Physically Based Rendering (PBR)  
- Shadow mapping
- Post-processing effects including blur and chromatic aberration  

## Shader Development
Authored a suite of **HLSL shaders** supporting:
- Dynamic lighting and material response  
- Screen-space effects and animated visuals  

## Engine Tooling
Built an **ImGui-based UI** to visualize render pipeline stages and provide real-time control over:
- Scene composition  
- Entity transforms  
- Materials and rendering settings  

## Takeaways
This project deepened my understanding of **graphics pipelines, shader authoring, and real-time rendering architecture**.
