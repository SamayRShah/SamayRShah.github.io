## Overview

_Deck of Ruin_ is a rogue-like deckbuilding game. As Lead Programmer, I was responsible for designing and implementing the core gameplay architecture that supports dynamic card effects, reusable enemy behaviors, and long-term content growth.

## Design Goals

- Support complex card interactions without hard-coding behavior
- Enable designers to create new cards, enemies and encounters quickly
- Ensure combat systems remain scalable as content expands
- Randomly generated maps, and encounters

## Systems & Implementation

### Modular Enemy AI & Encounters

I developed a **node-based, modular AI system** that allows enemies to compose behaviors. This approach enabled:

- Reusable combat logic across enemy types
- Rapid iteration on encounter design
- Clear separation between behavior, intent, and execution

### Flexible Card System

I engineered a **data-driven card system** capable of handling:

- Dynamic effects and conditional targeting
- Stackable modifiers and chained interactions
- Clean extensibility for future card additions

### Status Effect Framework

I also designed a **robust status effect system** with customizable modifiers. Effects could alter damage, behavior, or turn flow, and were designed to stack and interact cleanly with both cards and enemy AI.

## Collaboration & Process

Worked with a **3-person team** using agile practices, iterative prototyping, and regular playtesting. I also assisted with bug fixing, implementing UI elements, miscellaneous tasks like implementing utility shaders to change colors of icons, blur the background, and programming transitions, etc.

## Takeaways

This project strengthened my skills in **gameplay systems architecture**, modular design, and building tools that scale with content.
