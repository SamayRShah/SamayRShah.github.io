## Overview
This project focused on creating a fully game-ready 3D character, from concept to in-engine implementation, inspired by a Tamagotchi x Borderlands aesthetic.

## Production Pipeline
I handled the complete character pipeline:
- High-poly sculpting in **ZBrush**  
- Retopology and UV unwrapping in **Maya**  
- PBR texturing in **Substance Painter**  
- Rigging and engine integration in **Unreal Engine**

## Technical Implementation
- Optimized geometry and textures for real-time performance  
- Executed **animation retargeting** for reuse across rigs  
- Integrated **ragdoll physics** to enhance interactivity and physical response  

## Outcome
The final result was a polished, optimized character fully integrated into Unreal Engine.
