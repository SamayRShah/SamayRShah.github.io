This assignment was also relatively simple, but I had some slight challenges in implimenting it that I hadn't expected. The 1st challenge of which was gathering the right materials, which required identifying the 220Î© resistor, which I found by checking the resistors against the book's resistor graph. Additionally I had to resort to using tweezers to pick out the the switches, LED, and the right sized wires since they were too small to pick out normally.

Next, I created the series circuit where the switches were connected in 1 at a time, and to turn on the LED, both needed to be on at the same time, which reminded me of the AND operator in programming. This is where I was greatly challenged by attempting to manouver the wires into the sockets without them constantly falling over, or being unable to properly line things up, which I overcame by once again resorting to tweezers to line everything up and connect them.

Next, I created the parallel circuit, which only required 1 of the 2 switches to be on like the OR operator. Assembling this circuit also required tweezers, as well as moving the resistor and wires around a bit to get everything to fit into their slots.

Another big lesson I learnt from doing this project is that I need an organizer of sorts, since it's not easy to get the parts that I need by sifting through the bags and packets the kit came with.
