Welcome to my first blog post for IGME 470! This blog will be documenting my learning journey throughout this course. 
This 1st homework was simple, I opened the booklet and followed along with the instructions to pop-out the plastic pieces and assemble the 'case' for the Arduino and breadboard. I then downloaded the Arduino IDE, then connected the Arduino module to my laptop.

The Arduino had the blink sketch preloaded, so for testing, I uploaded the blink sketch with the delays changed to 100ms instead, and as expected, it blinked much faster.
